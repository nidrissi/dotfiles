#+TITLE: dotfiles

This repository the various configuration files that I use for several pieces of software, notably [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], [[https://www.zsh.org/][zsh]], [[https://i3wm.org/][i3]], etc.
I mostly follow the XDG path specification.
The [[misc/][misc]] folder contains files that are not technically part of my dotfiles (i.e. they don't reside in =$HOME=).
