# dotfiles

This repository the various configuration files that I use for several pieces of software, notably [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), etc.
I mostly follow the XDG path specification.
The [misc](misc/) folder contains files that are not technically part of my dotfiles (i.e. they don't reside in `$HOME`).
